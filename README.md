     Physical design is focussing on the macro inside the processor and also block level design.

CORE: It is the section of the chip where the fundamental logic of the design is placed.

DIE: A die, which consists of core, is small semiconductor material specimen on which the fundamental circuit is fabricated.

IO PADS: Pads are normally distributed around the edge of the IC. The pad should be large enough to have input or output circuitry.  Here, the pad is built to a standard width and height. The pad has large VDD and ground lines. The pad includes large piece of metal.

IP: An IP (intellectual property) core is a block of logic or data that is used in making a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for a product.

PDK: A Process Design Kit (PDK) is a library of basic photonic components generated by the foundry to give open access to their generic process for fabrication.

OPENLANE ASIC FLOW
             
             Open LANE is an open-source EDA toolchain designed for digital ASIC design and optimization, it has open everything SOC’S,OPEN PDK’S,OPEN EDA,OPEN RTL. It integrates various tools and flows to streamline the design process from RTL to GDSII. It produce clean GDSII with no human intervention.

Picorv32a design synthesis using OPENLANE flow

#Change Directory to openlane directory

cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

#To invoke openlane flow use command docker

docker

#setting openlane flow to be interactive mode

./flow.tcl -interactive

#input the openlane require package

package require openlane 0.9

#Now prep the design for the openlane flow

prep -design picorv32a

#run the synthesis using the command

run_synthesis
