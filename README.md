     Physical design is focussing on the macro inside the processor and also block level design.

CORE: It is the section of the chip where the fundamental logic of the design is placed.

DIE: A die, which consists of core, is small semiconductor material specimen on which the fundamental circuit is fabricated.

IO PADS: Pads are normally distributed around the edge of the IC. The pad should be large enough to have input or output circuitry.  Here, the pad is built to a standard width and height. The pad has large VDD and ground lines. The pad includes large piece of metal.

IP: An IP (intellectual property) core is a block of logic or data that is used in making a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for a product.

PDK: A Process Design Kit (PDK) is a library of basic photonic components generated by the foundry to give open access to their generic process for fabrication.
